Welcome! My Name is Albert Rapp and I am currently a PhD student in mathematics at Ulm University. As part of my obligations as a PhD student I had to teach an applied course on statistical techniques using the statistical software R. Interestingly, I noticed that I actually enjoy using R which is why I went the extra mile and decided to write a set of lecture notes on my own and made them accessible [online](https://yards.albert-rapp.de/). In fact, I realized that the process of writing felt (mostly) fun and my retention rate of the stuff I had to learn in order to write about it was actually quite high.

Consequently, I decided to make a habit out of writing about things I encounter in statistics and/or R. So, what you see here in this blog is the result of that decision. In the end, this is nothing but a personal project and is as much about helping me retain stuff as I learn new things as it is about making a contribution to the R community along the lines of many other blogs and tutorials that helped me learn R. Hopefully, what can be found here will be of benefit to someone other than me.

Currently, I aim at posting a new blog post on a biweekly schedule and regarding the content, I will write about whatever I find most interesting at the time of writing. On a long term basis though, I want to cover parts of my R/statistics bucket list which I described in the [final chapter of my YARDS lecture notes](https://yards.albert-rapp.de/what-comes-next.html).
